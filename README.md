<summary>Building from Source</summary>

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20.x or higher
- **pnpm** 9.x or higher — install with `npm install -g pnpm` (the project specifies `9.1.0` via the `packageManager` field; if you have [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) enabled, the correct version is used automatically)
- **Rust** (latest stable) — required for the Tauri backend. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git**

**Windows additional requirements:**
- [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) — required for Tauri's rendering engine
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ build tools
- Windows 10 SDK

### Instructions

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbeezy/ynotv.git
cd ynotv
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

**3. Download mpv sidecar**

FFmpeg is downloaded automatically during the build step, but mpv (and yt-dlp) must be downloaded manually first:

```bash
bash scripts/download-mpv-tauri.sh
```

*(Optional)* If you also want to pre-download FFmpeg manually:
```bash
cd packages/app
node scripts/download-ffmpeg.js
cd ../..
```

**4. Run in development mode**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts both the Vite UI dev server and the Tauri app concurrently.

**5. Build for production**

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Build output is located at:

```
packages/app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```
